---- Compute mean and rms energy for each point of the Bragg curve ----

The file contains data corresponding to events with different 
total energies: compute mean and rms energies selecting events 
with total energy between 6000 and 7500, without any background 
subtraction.

Add four arrays to the "main" program:
- one to contain, for each point, the sum of energies,
- one to contain, for each point, the sum of squares of energies,
- one to contain, for each point, the mean energy,
- one to contain, for each point, the rms  energy.

Dimension the arrays to the minimum number of points.
Use an "extern" variable to contain the minimum number of points, and 
choose in which source file to set it; it's to be set at 120.

Add two functions as described in the following.

***
Create a function "add" taking as arguments:
- a reference to const-event,
- two arrays for the sum of energies and the the sum of squares,
- two int numbers for the minimum and maximum total energy.
Inside the function compute the total energy of the event, by summing 
over all the points; to obtain results comparable for different events 
limit the sum to the minimum number of points.
If the total energy is comprised between the minimum and maximum 
use the energies in the points to increase the sums of energies 
and squares, otherwise leave those sums unchanged.
Return true or false if the total energy was in the range or not, 
respectively.

***
Create a function "stat" taking as arguments:
- the number of events,
- the number of points,
- the four arrays for the sum of energies, the sum of squares, 
  the mean energies and the rms.
Inside the function compute, for each point, mean and rms starting
from the sums of energies and squares and the number of events.

***
Create a main function reading the file and calling the 
add and stat functions, using 6000 and 7500 as min and max total energy.
Compute the number of events by increasing a counter according to 
the return value of the "add" function.
Use the minimum number of points when calling the "stat" function.
Print the results on the screen.
